# crocus-raytracer

This is a ray-tracer I implemented at my sophomore year(2012). Its an
impelementation of Kevin Suffern's book Ray Tracing from the Ground Up(using wxWidgets)
but using Qt4. Originally, I wrote it under Windows
with Visual Studio 2005/2008, now I usually use Fedora 21 with my works, I'm going to
rewrite it with Qt5, and add a GUI, surely make it compatible to Windows
and *nix operating system.
