# crocus-raytracer

This is a ray-tracer I implemented at my sophomore year(2012). Its an<br/>
impelementation of Kevin Suffern's book <Ray Tracing from the Ground Up><br/>
but using Qt4(using wxWidgets at first). Originally, I wrote it under Windows<br/>
with Visual Studio 2005/2008, now I usually use Fedora 21 with my works, I'm<br/>
going rewrite it with Qt5, and add a GUI, surely make it compatible to Windows
and *nix operating system.
